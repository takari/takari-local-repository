# Takari Concurrent Local Repository

This project is being archived, while main features are today provided by Maven Resolver 1.7+, see here https://maven.apache.org/resolver/local-repository.html#shared-access-to-local-repository

The Takari Concurrent Local Repository component is a replacement for the management of a local Maven repository 
of a default Maven installation. It makes access to the local repository safe for concurrent access from multiple 
threads and Maven invocations. 

Documentation for usage and more is available in the Takari TEAM documentation at http://takari.io/book/index.html
